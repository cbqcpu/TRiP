## Data Preprocessing

If you choose to start with the raw data from CNCB, follow the steps below to process it.

1.  **Run the Python preprocessing scripts** for each cell line to process the raw files:
    ```bash
    python preprocess_HEK293T.py
    python preprocess_THP1.py
    ```
2.  **Next, run the R scripts** to load the processed data into R objects for analysis:
    ```R
    "load_data_to_R_293_all_sample.R"
    "load_data_to_R_THP1_all_sample.R"
    ```

## Reproducing Figures

To reproduce all the figures in the paper, you can use the pre-processed data provided. This is the recommended and most straightforward approach.

1.  **Download the processed data** from Google Drive:
    > **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rdiGYeeCrGBGh4Fh4qhOqvRbHUZpBayy?usp=sharing**

2.  Place the downloaded data into the project's working directory.

3.  **Run the analysis scripts** for each figure to generate the plots:
    * `Figure1.R`
    * `Figure2.R`
    * `Figure3.R`
    * `Figure4.R`
    * `Figure5.R`

*Note: Please ensure you have all the necessary R and Python packages installed. Check the script files for specific library dependencies.*
